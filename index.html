<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  I am a third-year M.S. student in the Guangxi Key Lab of Human-machine Interaction and Intelligent Decision at Nanning Normal University, under the supervision of Prof. Yuzhong Peng.
</p>

<p>
  My research interests focus on <strong>structure-based drug design</strong>, <strong>3D molecular generation</strong>, and <strong>deep learning for molecular property prediction</strong>. I am also passionate about <strong>geometric deep learning</strong> on protein-ligand complexes, as well as the development and application of <strong>diffusion models</strong>, <strong>transformers</strong>, and <strong>graph neural networks</strong> for molecular modeling and analysis.
