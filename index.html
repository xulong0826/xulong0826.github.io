<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
  I am a third-year M.S. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanning Normal University, affiliated with the Guangxi Key Lab of Human-machine Interaction and Intelligent Decision. I'm honored to be advised by Prof. Yuzhong Peng.
</p>

<p>
  My research interests include <strong>structure-based drug design</strong>, <strong>3D molecular generation</strong>, <strong>deep learning for molecular property prediction</strong>, and <strong>geometric deep learning on protein-ligand complexes</strong>. I am also passionate about <strong>diffusion models</strong>, <strong>transformers</strong>, and <strong>graph neural networks</strong> for molecular modeling and analysis.
